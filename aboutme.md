## My History

I have a BA in Liberal Arts from the Eugene Lang College (at the New School University). During college, I worked as a transportation planner. I worked on a web app to match commuters into carpools called [511NY Rideshare](https://www.511nyrideshare.org). I worked on the project from the vendor selection phase to product planning and included a phase where several legacy systems were combined into the new system. My job entailed doing some marketing and product analysis and reporting work. It was during this time that I developed an interest in Digital Products & Marketing. 

In 2013, I relocated to Chicago. After moving to Chicago, I attended the Startup Institute in the Spring of 2014. I learned all aspects of digital marketing including SEO, SEM, Content Planning & Production, Paid & Organic Social, CRM, Email & Conversion Optimization. I worked with a local company to plan & market their app that seeks to digitize the lost & found systems at large public spaces & festivals. After completing the Startup Institute's program I did some contract work with several local companies, mostly around setting up paid search programs. 

At the end of the summer of 2014, I took an SEM Specialist position at [Brad's Deals](https://www.bradsdeals.com). I worked mostly on search and Facebook advertising. I managed budget of between $750,000 and $1,000,000 per month. I experimented with two changes to the lead gen process at Brad's Deals: First, I worked with the product team to modify the lead gen landing page from a simple page with a form to being able to fire a lightbox modal when a paged load so the user could see the discounted products that Brad's Deals was advertisitng. Second, I modified the ad creative to show specific deals on products to help increase CTR and CVR. 

In 2015, I took a position at Digital Intent, a digital innovation studio headquartered in Chicago. In my positon as Growth Manager I worked with several clients to set up growth marketing process and acquire initial users. 

Seeking to advance my career, in 2019 I became Director of Growth at [LandscapeHub](https://www.landscapehub.com), an online markeplace for the landscape industry. With LandscapeHub, businesses who buy landscape materials can search plants, view availablity, build job quotes and purchase materials online. Suppliers are able to easily list accurate inventories and acquire new customers. As Director of Growth I set up a system to track & report on business metrics and growth process pritotization & tracking. I also acquired users through paid placements, moved our CRM activities from MailChimp to HubSpot and worked with product & development teams to build & A/B test features to improve activation. While at LandscapeHub, I was able to triple the conversion rate on landing pages and improve efficiencny of converting landing page leads into users by funneling landing page leads to a pre-filled registration page. Unfortunately, the indsutry may not have been ready for an online procurement solution and I was laid off in October 2019.
